Costain Technical Assessment

Using Spring Boot construct a Java 11 application which presents a RESTful API.

The API should contain at least 3 methods:
* concat
** this allows the client to specify a list of strings in a request and the server returns a single JSON object containing all the strings concatenated together
* addition
** this allows the client to specify a list of floating point numbers in a request and the server returns a single JSON object containing the sum of the numbers
* modulo
** this allows the client to specify two numbers in a request and the server returns a single JSON object containing the signed remainder of division
